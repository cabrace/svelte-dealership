Main notes taken from ['How to create a SvelteKit and MongoDB app.'](https://awstip.com/how-to-create-a-svelte-kit-and-mongodb-app-63de01c6ff71)
However it is slightly modified to account for the new +page.svelte naming conventions where routing is now stored in its corresponding
folder name structure.
